(ARGUED), Bank Towers Building, 321 Spruce Street, Suite 509, 1500 Liberty Center, Scranton, PA 18503, Counsel for Petitioner Matthew A. Connelly, Esq. (ARGUED), Thomas. W. Hussey, Esq., United States Department of Justice, Office of Immigration Litigation, P.O. Box 878, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044, Counsel for Respondent\n",
      "OPINIONThis appeal requires us to determine whether Wilson Emilio Peguero Mateo's conspiracy plea for Robbery of a Motor Vehicle under Pennsylvania law qualifies as a “crime of violence” under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), as incorporated into 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”). In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson v. United States, ––– U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), and our decision in Baptiste v. Attorney General, 841 F.3d 601, 621 (3d Cir. 2016), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Feb. 6, 2017) (No. 16-978), we hold that § 16(b), as incorporated into the INA, is unconstitutionally vague. We will therefore grant the Petition for Review, vacate the order of removal, and remand for further proceedings.I.Mateo is a twenty-one-year-old native and citizen of the Dominican Republic who was admitted to the United States on August 11, 2010 as a lawful permanent resident. On June 17, 2013, he pleaded guilty to the felony charge of criminal conspiracy pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 903. The underlying offense for his conspiracy plea was Robbery of a Motor Vehicle under Pennsylvania law, which dictates that “[a] person commits a felony of the first degree if he steals or takes a motor vehicle from another person in the presence of that person or any other person in lawful possession of the motor vehicle.” 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3702. On December 3, 2013, Mateo was convicted and sentenced to eleven to twenty-three months' confinement, and thirty-six months' probation.On January 16, 2014, the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) served Mateo with a Notice to Appear, charging Mateo as removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to § 237(a)(2)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A). Specifically, DHS stated that Mateo was subject to removal because his Robbery of a Motor Vehicle conviction constituted an aggravated felony under INA § 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and was a “crime of violence” as defined in INA § 101(a)(43)(F), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F).1 To define a “crime of violence,” the INA incorporates 18 U.S.C. § 16, which defines the phrase as follows:The term “crime of violence” means—(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.Mateo filed a Motion to Terminate Proceedings, challenging his removability on the ground that Robbery of a Motor Vehicle is not an aggravated felony because it is not a crime of violence as defined in § 16(b). The Immigration Judge (“IJ”) disagreed, finding that Robbery of a Motor Vehicle is a crime of violence, and sustained the charge of removability based on Mateo's conspiracy conviction.2 Mateo appealed the IJ's decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”). The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision with regard to Mateo's removability as an alien convicted of conspiracy to commit an aggravated felony that was deemed a crime of violence. The BIA did not address the remaining aspects of the IJ's decision and Mateo's appeal was dismissed. This Petition for Review ensued.On appeal before this Court, Mateo initially argued that the BIA improperly determined, as a matter of law, that Robbery of a Motor Vehicle is a “crime of violence” under § 16(b), as incorporated into the INA. Accordingly, he requested that, per this Court's opinion in Aguilar v. Attorney General of the United States, 663 F.3d 692 (3d Cir. 2011), we find that the Robbery of a Motor Vehicle statute is “overly broad” and that, using the categorical approach, his conviction under the statute was not a crime of violence under the INA. The case was initially submitted on the briefs without argument.Just before the case was submitted, however, the Government filed a letter pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) informing the Court that the Ninth Circuit, in Dimaya v. Lynch, 803 F.3d 1110 (2015), held that § 16(b), as incorporated into the INA, is unconstitutionally vague in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson v. United States, ––– U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Mateo then sent his own Rule 28(j) letter, arguing we should also find that § 16(b), as incorporated into the INA, is unconstitutionally vague. Thereafter, we ordered supplemental briefing and oral argument addressing whether the vagueness standard should be applied in the immigration context and, if so, whether § 16(b), as incorporated into the INA, is unconstitutionally vague given the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson.Pending in our own Court at the time we heard oral argument in this matter was a petition for review in another deportation case, Baptiste v. Attorney General, No. 14-4476, which also presented the question of whether the definition of “crime of violence” in 18 U.S.C. § 16(b) is void for vagueness. We deferred reaching a decision in this matter pending a ruling in Baptiste. Separately, on September 29, 2016, certiorari was granted in Dimaya.3 In light of this development, we opted to hold this matter C.A.V.4 Dimaya was argued before the Supreme Court on January 17, 2017, and a ruling was expected by the end of June, 2017. Then, on June 26, 2017, the Court ordered that Dimaya be re-argued during the Court's October 2017 term. Given the further delay and the fact that this proceeding has been pending for a considerable period of time, we have chosen to decide Mateo's petition for review. In doing so, we must now follow our precedential holding in Baptiste, which on November 8, 2016, held that 18 U.S.C. § 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague when applied in a removal proceeding.5 841 F.3d 601, 621 (3d Cir. 2016).II.The IJ had jurisdiction over Mateo's removal proceeding pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. The BIA had jurisdiction to consider Mateo's appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(3). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a), we have jurisdiction to consider “ ‘questions of law raised upon a petition for review,’ including petitions for review of removal orders based on aggravated felony convictions.” Tran v. Gonzales, 414 F.3d 464, 467 (3d Cir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)). “Since the interpretation of criminal provisions ‘is a task outside the BIA's special competence and congressional delegation ․ [and] very much a part of this Court's competence,’ our review is de novo.” Aguilar, 663 F.3d at 695 (quoting Tran, 414 F.3d at 467).III.This appeal turns on the two questions we posed to the parties for supplemental briefing: (1) whether the constitutional vagueness standard should be applied in the civil/immigration context and, if so, (2) whether § 16(b), as incorporated into the INA, is unconstitutionally vague given the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson. The second question has been answered in the affirmative by Baptiste, and we are bound by that holding.6 We now answer the first question in the affirmative as well.A.The Supreme Court has explained that the “ ‘void for vagueness' doctrine [is] applicable to civil as well as criminal actions.” Boutilier v. INS, 387 U.S. 118, 123, 87 S.Ct. 1563, 18 L.Ed.2d 661 (1967) (citation omitted). In San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, this Court noted that “[l]esser degrees of specificity are required to overcome a vagueness challenge in the civil context than in the criminal context ․ because the consequences in the criminal context are more severe.” 961 F.2d 1125, 1135 (3d Cir. 1992) (citing Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 498–99, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982)). Because the consequences of deportation are likewise severe, we take this opportunity to clarify that the vagueness doctrine should be applied in the civil immigration context just as it is applied in the criminal context, and that lesser degrees of specificity are not sufficient to overcome a vagueness challenge.Indeed, the Supreme Court invoked the vagueness doctrine in the immigration context in Jordan v. De George precisely because of the severity of deportation. 341 U.S. 223, 231, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951) (“Despite the fact that this is not a criminal statute, we shall nevertheless examine the application of the vagueness doctrine to this case. We do this in view of the grave nature of deportation.”). After the Supreme Court's decision in Jordan, the Court has since made it clear that “[i]t is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.” Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) (citing Kaoru Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86, 100–01, 23 S.Ct. 611, 47 L.Ed. 721 (1903)). And as Justice Thomas explained in Johnson, the Supreme Court has “become accustomed to using the Due Process Clauses to invalidate laws on the ground of ‘vagueness,’ ” as the doctrine “is quite sweeping” where a statute “ ‘authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.’ ” 135 S.Ct. at 2566 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000)).Moreover, it is “ ‘difficult’ to divorce the penalty from the conviction in the deportation context.” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 365, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010) (citations omitted). Accordingly, we hold that the vagueness doctrine may be used in the immigration context to challenge the INA's definition of a crime of violence. Cf. Dimaya, 803 F.3d at 1112–13; Shuti v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 440, 445 (6th Cir. 2016) (“The criminal versus civil distinction is ․ ‘ill suited’ to evaluating a vagueness challenge regarding the ‘specific risk of deportation.’ ” (citing Padilla, 559 U.S. at 365–66, 130 S.Ct. 1473)).The Government nonetheless maintains that the vagueness doctrine should not be applied in the immigration context. Specifically, even though the Supreme Court invoked the vagueness doctrine in the immigration context in Jordan, the Government contends that the Supreme Court “did not squarely decide the extent to which the vagueness doctrine applies to the immigration laws.” United States' Suppl. Letter Br. at 1 n.2. To make this point, the Government notes that other Supreme Court cases after Jordan have declined to extend Fifth Amendment limitations in some immigration contexts. See id. (citing Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 530–31, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911 (1954); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 588–91, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952); Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 314, 75 S.Ct. 757, 99 L.Ed. 1107 (1955)). The Government's concerns with respect to the application of the vagueness doctrine in the context of the deportation sanction, however, are misguided.The Government's concerns fail to account for the central tenet of the vagueness doctrine: in this case, affording aliens “fair notice” of the possibility of removal to ensure the “even-handed administration of the law.” Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 171, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972). After all, the Supreme Court has explained that “accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important” because, “as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part—indeed, sometimes the most important part—of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.” Padilla, 559 U.S. at 364, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (footnote omitted). And even more recently, the Court has further stressed the need for “efficiency, fairness, and predictability in the administration of immigration law” in order to “enable [ ] aliens ‘to anticipate the immigration consequences of guilty pleas in criminal court,’ and to enter ‘safe harbor’ guilty pleas [that] do not expose the [alien defendant] to the risk of immigration sanctions.” Mellouli v. Lynch, ––– U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1980, 1987, 192 L.Ed.2d 60 (2015) (citations omitted).Any semblance of predictability and fairness would be frustrated if we were to find that the crime of violence language in § 16(b) is subject to vagueness challenges outside of the immigration context, yet the same language is not subject to vagueness challenges when incorporated into an immigration statute. Cf. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 523, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003) (explaining that it “is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings”) (internal quotation marks omitted); A.B. Small Co. v. Am. Sugar Ref. Co., 267 U.S. 233, 239, 45 S.Ct. 295, 69 L.Ed. 589 (1925) (“The ground or principle of the [vagueness] decisions was not such as to be applicable only to criminal prosecutions.”). Accordingly, for the sake of predictability and fairness, we find that aliens should get fair notice of the possibility of removal based upon a conviction that the Government contends is for a crime of violence.B.Because we find that the vagueness doctrine may be used in the immigration context to challenge the INA's definition of a crime of violence, we must now determine whether § 16(b) is “so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.” Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2556 (citation omitted). As noted above, we are bound by our precedential decision in Baptiste, which held that § 16(b) as applied in the immigration context is unconstitutionally vague and therefore invalid in light of Johnson. 841 F.3d at 615–21.1.In Johnson, the Supreme Court examined whether the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”) was unconstitutionally vague. Where certain defendants have three or more prior convictions for a “violent felony,” the ACCA provides a sentence enhancement. Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2555. “Violent felony” is defined as a crime that is “burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The portion pertaining to a crime that “otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury” is known as the residual clause.Prior to Johnson, the ACCA required courts to use the categorical approach when deciding whether an offense fell within the residual clause. “Under the categorical approach, a court assesses whether a crime qualifies as a violent felony ‘in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.’ ” Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2557 (quoting Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008)). Thus, determining “whether the residual clause covers a crime [ ] require[d] a court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in ‘the ordinary case,’ and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.” Id. (quoting James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 194, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007)).The Supreme Court found that “[t]wo features of the residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague”: the ordinary case inquiry and the serious potential risk inquiry. Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2557–58; Baptiste, 841 F.3d at 616. The ordinary case inquiry, explained above, raised “grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.” Id. at 2557. Application of the categorical approach required the courts to conceptualize what the ordinary case of a crime might look like—which might involve many varying iterations—and the “residual clause offers no reliable way to choose between these competing accounts of what an ‘ordinary’ [crime] involves.” Id. at 2558. The serious potential risk inquiry was also troublesome because “the residual clause leaves uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.” Id. The Court concluded that “[b]y combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.” Id.2.The petitioner in Baptiste, like Mateo, faced removal on the basis of his purported status as an alien convicted of a crime of violence under § 16(b). As stated previously, § 16(b) defines a crime of violence as “any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.” In order to determine whether the crime of conviction is a crime of violence under § 16(b), courts utilize the same categorical approach that was applied to the ACCA's residual clause. Baptiste, 841 F.3d at 617.The petitioner in Baptiste argued that the Supreme Court's holding in Johnson striking down the residual clause should apply to negate § 16(b). After comparing the features of the § 16(b) analysis to those found to contribute to the unconstitutionality of the residual clause in Johnson, we agreed that the same defects were present in § 16(b), rendering the provision unconstitutional. Regarding the first feature, we recognized that the same “ordinary case inquiry” is used when applying the categorical approach in both contexts. Id. Like the residual clause, § 16(b) “offers no reliable way to choose between ․ competing accounts of what” that “judge-imagined abstraction” of the crime involves. Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2558. Thus, we concluded in Baptiste that “the ordinary case inquiry is as indeterminate in the § 16(b) context as it was in the residual clause context.” 841 F.3d at 617. Turning to the second feature—the risk inquiry—we observed that despite slight linguistic differences between the provisions, the same indeterminacy inherent in the residual clause was present in § 16(b). Id. “[B]ecause the two inquiries under the residual clause that the Supreme Court found to be indeterminate—the ordinary case inquiry and the serious potential risk inquiry—are materially the same as the inquiries under § 16(b),” we concluded that “§ 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague.” Id. at 621. This conclusion applies equally to Mateo's petition.Our treatment of § 16(b) is in step with the Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, which have all similarly deemed the provision to be void for vagueness in immigration cases. See Shuti, 828 F.3d at 451; Dimaya, 803 F.3d at 1120; Golicov v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1065, 1072 (10th Cir. 2016). The Seventh Circuit has also taken this position in the criminal context. See United States v. Vivas-Ceja, 808 F.3d 719, 723 (7th Cir. 2015). In fact, the only circuit that has broken stride is the Fifth Circuit.7 See United States v. Gonzalez-Longoria, 831 F.3d 670, 677 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc). In the meantime, we await the Supreme Court's decision in the appeal of Dimaya.IV.For the reasons discussed herein, we will grant the Petition for Review, vacate the order of removal, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.FOOTNOTES1.   Though not relevant to this case, the DHS also charged that Mateo was removable as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A). Specifically, the DHS stated that Mateo was subject to removal because his conviction also constituted a crime involving moral turpitude, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), because it was a crime of theft, as defined in 8 US.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G); and a crime of attempt or conspiracy to commit an aggravated felony, as defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(U).2.   The IJ dismissed the other charges with respect to crimes of theft because Mateo was only convicted of a conspiracy to commit Robbery of a Motor Vehicle; not the underlying offense itself. The IJ did not address the charge based on a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.3.   Cert. granted, ––– U.S. ––––, 137 S.Ct. 31, 195 L.Ed.2d 902 (2016).4.   C.A.V. is the abbreviation for the Latin legal phrase, curia advisari vult, meaning “the court will be advised, will consider, will deliberate.” In re Mystic Tank Lines Corp., 544 F.3d 524, 526 n.1 (3d Cir. 2008). It is the term we use when we hold an appeal in abeyance pending the outcome of another proceeding.5.   Baptiste was not held C.A.V. pending the Court's ruling in Dimaya because the petitioner had also been found removable for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude, and thus was removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). While the petitioner in Baptiste prevailed on the crime of violence issue, he ultimately lost on the crime involving moral turpitude issue and his petition for review was denied. 841 F.3d at 623.6.   Third Circuit Internal Operating Procedure 9.1 states that the holding of a panel in a precedential opinion is binding on subsequent panels. Court en banc consideration is required to overrule such a holding. See United States v. Brownlee, 454 F.3d 131, 149 (3d Cir. 2006).7.   We note that the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits have concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), which contains language nearly identical to § 16(b), survives Johnson. See United States v. Hill, 832 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2016); United States v. Taylor, 814 F.3d 340, 375–79 (6th Cir. 2016); United States v. Prickett, 839 F.3d 697 (8th Cir. 2016); Ovalles v. United States, 861 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir. 2017); United States v. Eshetu, 863 F.3d 946, 961 (D.C. Cir. 2017). But, as the Sixth Circuit recognized in reconciling its holding in Shuti that § 16(b) is void with its earlier decision in Taylor, “[u]nlike the ACCA and INA, which require a categorical approach to stale predicate convictions, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) is a criminal offense that requires an ultimate determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt—by a jury, in the same proceeding.” Shuti, 828 F.3d at 449. In short, reasonable minds can and do differ over how the Supreme Court's reasoning in Johnson applies in different contexts.VANASKIE, Circuit Judge.\n",

       "Petitioners seek review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (the “BIA”) upholding an immigration judge's finding that they are removable from the United States under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1) and ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii). Petitioners contend that a single member of the BIA issued an improper written opinion that went beyond the scope of an individual BIA member's power to affirm, modify, or remand an immigration judge's decision in a “brief order” pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). This court's jurisdiction over final orders of removal is governed by 8 U.S.C. § 1252. The written order issued by the BIA on March 31, 2010 constitutes a final order of removal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(7); therefore the case is properly before this court.I. BACKGROUNDPetitioner Ward and her daughter Cainto, natives and citizens of the Philippines, entered the United States in March 2004 on non-immigrant K visas. Ward entered on a K-1 visa as the fiancée of a United States citizen and Cainto entered on a K-2 visa as a minor child accompanying her mother to the United States.Ward married her citizen fiancé in May 2004. The marriage dissolved shortly thereafter and Ward never applied for permanent resident status based upon her marriage. In November 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) ordered petitioners to appear before an immigration judge to explain why they should not be removed from the United States for having overstayed their visas. Prior to her removal hearing, Ward petitioned DHS for an immigrant visa under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii), a statute which enables the former spouse of a United States citizen who was subjected to battery or extreme cruelty to remain in the United States. DHS denied Ward's petition for this special visa in April 2007. In December 2008, an immigration judge conducted a merits hearing to adjudicate whether petitioners were removable and, if so, whether their application for cancellation of removal was properly denied. The immigration judge found that removability had been established by evidence that was “clear and convincing” and that petitioners were ineligible for cancellation of removal. The BIA affirmed in a three-page decision issued by a single member on March 31, 2010.II. DISCUSSIONPetitioners urge us to remand their case to the BIA with instructions to review their appeal in a three-member panel. In their view, the order issued by a single member pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) overstepped the BIA's own bounds for reviewing immigration appeals in such a manner. For the reasons described below, we decline to grant petitioners the relief they seek in this matter.We begin with the question of jurisdiction. Only constitutional claims and questions of law properly raised in connection with an order of removal are reviewable. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). Legal questions include “challenges to the BIA's interpretation of a statute, regulation, or constitutional provision, claims that the BIA misread its own precedent or applied the wrong legal standard, or claims that the BIA failed to exercise discretion at all.” Patel v. Holder, 563 F.3d 565, 568 (7th Cir.2009). We find that the question raised by petitioners is a legal one, since it involves interpretation of the guidelines set for review of immigration appeals under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e).In the immigration context, a two-pronged analysis governs whether failure to adhere to an administrative guideline renders the underlying action taken invalid. First, the regulation in question must serve a “purpose of benefit to the alien.” Martinez-Camargo v. INS, 282 F.3d 487, 491 (7th Cir.2002) (quoting Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I. & N. Dec. 325 (B.I.A.1980). If the regulation is found to serve a purpose of benefit to the alien, the action is then invalid only if the violation “prejudiced the interests of the alien protected by the regulation.” Id. As the BIA itself put it in Garcia-Flores, “where an entire procedural framework, designed to insure the fair processing of an action affecting an individual is created but then not followed by an agency, it can be deemed prejudicial.” Garcia-Flores, 17 I. & N. at 329. The analysis adopted in Martinez-Camargo endeavors to strike a balance between “recognizing the need for administrative agencies to follow their own rules” and acknowledging “the practical reality that not every agency violation impacts an alien's substantive rights.”\n",
       "Martinez-Camargo, 282 F.3d at 491. In order to assess whether the regulation serves a purpose of benefit to the alien, we must first look to the language of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1.Section 1003.1 of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations governs the organization, jurisdiction, and powers of the BIA. Under subsection (e)(3), a single board member is initially assigned to an appeal using the BIA's case management system. The member assigned to that appeal is then vested with the authority to determine how it should be handled by the BIA. The member may summarily dismiss the appeal once the record is complete or may elect to have the case decided on the merits. A decision on the merits is issued in one of three ways. In the most straightforward cases, a formulaic “affirmance without opinion” is issued by the member pursuant to subsection (e)(4). In cases requiring more in-depth analysis, the member may issue a brief order pursuant to subsection (e)(5) or designate the appeal for review by a three-member panel pursuant to subsection (e)(6). The default is single member review. (“[T]he Board member shall issue a brief order ․ unless the Board member designates the case for decision by a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6)․” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) (emphasis added).Various circumstances set forth in subsection (e)(6) provide a basis for referral of an appeal to a three-member panel. These circumstances include the need to settle inconsistencies among rulings of different judges, the need to establish precedent, the need to review a decision not in conformity with the law, and the need to review a clearly erroneous factual determination by a judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(6). While we agree with the respondent that a “designed effect” of the case management provisions set forth in § 1003.1(e) is to assist the BIA in managing its caseload, we find that the provisions nonetheless serve a purpose of benefit to the alien. Though settling inconsistencies and establishing precedent undoubtedly assists the BIA in managing its caseload, such action is also designed to rectify errors below that may have unfairly prejudiced an alien. The fact that the presence of a “need to review a clearly erroneous factual determination” is a basis for three-member panel review underscores that the regulations were designed in the interests of justice as well as efficiency.Having found that § 1003.1(e) serves a purpose of benefit to aliens, we are left to consider whether a violation of the regulations set forth therein prejudiced petitioners. Since we have held that a streamlined review process withstands constitutional challenges on due process grounds1 , absent a violation of the applicable streamlining procedures, petitioners cannot be entitled to relief.The § 1003.1(e) streamlining procedures afford the single member initially assigned to any given appeal significant discretion. Prior to the enactment of subsection (e)(5) in 2002, a single member could only affirm without opinion. By adopting subsection (e)(5), the drafters intentionally expanded single member review. Subsection (e)(5) now gives BIA members the power to modify and remand the decisions of immigration judges in their sole discretion. It also confers upon them the right to explain their decisions if they don't feel a formulaic disposition of the appeal is appropriate. While subsection (e)(5) provides that a single member may refer an appeal to a three-member panel, this court has not interpreted the subsection to require such a referral. See Gutnik v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 683, 691 (7th Cir.2006). The fact that petitioners' appeal may have been eligible for review by a three-member panel under the standards of the BIA's case management plan but was instead reviewed by a single member acting alone is irrelevant. In our view, it is apparent from the plain language of § 1003.1(e) that discretion in these matters is left to the panel member assigned to the case.The heart of petitioners' argument is that the decision issued by a single BIA member in the case was not a “brief” order, as the language of subsection (e)(5) describes. Because the decision was perhaps lengthier than the average single-member decision, they argue the decision could only have appropriately been rendered by a three-member panel. This dogged focus on what is or is not “brief” provides no substantive evidence of abuse of discretion under the guidelines. To require referral to a three-member panel in each case that lends itself to more than a cookie-cutter order would be contrary to the plain language of § 1003.1(e). It would also “greatly weaken the designed effect [of the regulations] by encouraging BIA members to ignore the subsection (e)(5) procedure altogether and send anything requiring elaboration to a three-member panel.” Id. at 692. We find that the language of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 is sufficiently clear in allowing a single member of the BIA to issue an order such as the one rendered in petitioners' case. Ergo, we cannot find that the BIA violated the review procedures set forth in § 1003.1(e) when a single member rendered a decision on petitioners' appeal in his discretion without referring it to a panel of three. Having found no violation, we need not consider whether petitioners were prejudiced by the way the appeal was handled.III. CONCLUSIONWhile it may be prudent to require that certain appeals to the BIA be adjudicated by a three-member panel instead of a single member acting alone, we leave it to the drafters of the regulations to enact such a change if they find it to be necessary.

       "Petitioners seek review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (the “BIA”) upholding an immigration judge's finding that they are removable from the United States under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1) and ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii). Petitioners contend that a single member of the BIA issued an improper written opinion that went beyond the scope of an individual BIA member's power to affirm, modify, or remand an immigration judge's decision in a “brief order” pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). This court's jurisdiction over final orders of removal is governed by 8 U.S.C. § 1252. The written order issued by the BIA on March 31, 2010 constitutes a final order of removal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(7); therefore the case is properly before this court.I. BACKGROUNDPetitioner Ward and her daughter Cainto, natives and citizens of the Philippines, entered the United States in March 2004 on non-immigrant K visas. Ward entered on a K-1 visa as the fiancée of a United States citizen and Cainto entered on a K-2 visa as a minor child accompanying her mother to the United States.Ward married her citizen fiancé in May 2004. The marriage dissolved shortly thereafter and Ward never applied for permanent resident status based upon her marriage. In November 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) ordered petitioners to appear before an immigration judge to explain why they should not be removed from the United States for having overstayed their visas. Prior to her removal hearing, Ward petitioned DHS for an immigrant visa under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii), a statute which enables the former spouse of a United States citizen who was subjected to battery or extreme cruelty to remain in the United States. DHS denied Ward's petition for this special visa in April 2007. In December 2008, an immigration judge conducted a merits hearing to adjudicate whether petitioners were removable and, if so, whether their application for cancellation of removal was properly denied. The immigration judge found that removability had been established by evidence that was “clear and convincing” and that petitioners were ineligible for cancellation of removal. The BIA affirmed in a three-page decision issued by a single member on March 31, 2010.II. DISCUSSIONPetitioners urge us to remand their case to the BIA with instructions to review their appeal in a three-member panel. In their view, the order issued by a single member pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) overstepped the BIA's own bounds for reviewing immigration appeals in such a manner. For the reasons described below, we decline to grant petitioners the relief they seek in this matter.We begin with the question of jurisdiction. Only constitutional claims and questions of law properly raised in connection with an order of removal are reviewable. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). Legal questions include “challenges to the BIA's interpretation of a statute, regulation, or constitutional provision, claims that the BIA misread its own precedent or applied the wrong legal standard, or claims that the BIA failed to exercise discretion at all.” Patel v. Holder, 563 F.3d 565, 568 (7th Cir.2009). We find that the question raised by petitioners is a legal one, since it involves interpretation of the guidelines set for review of immigration appeals under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e).In the immigration context, a two-pronged analysis governs whether failure to adhere to an administrative guideline renders the underlying action taken invalid. First, the regulation in question must serve a “purpose of benefit to the alien.” Martinez-Camargo v. INS, 282 F.3d 487, 491 (7th Cir.2002) (quoting Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I. & N. Dec. 325 (B.I.A.1980). If the regulation is found to serve a purpose of benefit to the alien, the action is then invalid only if the violation “prejudiced the interests of the alien protected by the regulation.” Id. As the BIA itself put it in Garcia-Flores, “where an entire procedural framework, designed to insure the fair processing of an action affecting an individual is created but then not followed by an agency, it can be deemed prejudicial.” Garcia-Flores, 17 I. & N. at 329. The analysis adopted in Martinez-Camargo endeavors to strike a balance between “recognizing the need for administrative agencies to follow their own rules” and acknowledging “the practical reality that not every agency violation impacts an alien's substantive rights.”\n",
       "Martinez-Camargo, 282 F.3d at 491. In order to assess whether the regulation serves a purpose of benefit to the alien, we must first look to the language of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1.Section 1003.1 of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations governs the organization, jurisdiction, and powers of the BIA. Under subsection (e)(3), a single board member is initially assigned to an appeal using the BIA's case management system. The member assigned to that appeal is then vested with the authority to determine how it should be handled by the BIA. The member may summarily dismiss the appeal once the record is complete or may elect to have the case decided on the merits. A decision on the merits is issued in one of three ways. In the most straightforward cases, a formulaic “affirmance without opinion” is issued by the member pursuant to subsection (e)(4). In cases requiring more in-depth analysis, the member may issue a brief order pursuant to subsection (e)(5) or designate the appeal for review by a three-member panel pursuant to subsection (e)(6). The default is single member review. (“[T]he Board member shall issue a brief order ․ unless the Board member designates the case for decision by a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6)․” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) (emphasis added).Various circumstances set forth in subsection (e)(6) provide a basis for referral of an appeal to a three-member panel. These circumstances include the need to settle inconsistencies among rulings of different judges, the need to establish precedent, the need to review a decision not in conformity with the law, and the need to review a clearly erroneous factual determination by a judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(6). While we agree with the respondent that a “designed effect” of the case management provisions set forth in § 1003.1(e) is to assist the BIA in managing its caseload, we find that the provisions nonetheless serve a purpose of benefit to the alien. Though settling inconsistencies and establishing precedent undoubtedly assists the BIA in managing its caseload, such action is also designed to rectify errors below that may have unfairly prejudiced an alien. The fact that the presence of a “need to review a clearly erroneous factual determination” is a basis for three-member panel review underscores that the regulations were designed in the interests of justice as well as efficiency.Having found that § 1003.1(e) serves a purpose of benefit to aliens, we are left to consider whether a violation of the regulations set forth therein prejudiced petitioners. Since we have held that a streamlined review process withstands constitutional challenges on due process grounds1 , absent a violation of the applicable streamlining procedures, petitioners cannot be entitled to relief.The § 1003.1(e) streamlining procedures afford the single member initially assigned to any given appeal significant discretion. Prior to the enactment of subsection (e)(5) in 2002, a single member could only affirm without opinion. By adopting subsection (e)(5), the drafters intentionally expanded single member review. Subsection (e)(5) now gives BIA members the power to modify and remand the decisions of immigration judges in their sole discretion. It also confers upon them the right to explain their decisions if they don't feel a formulaic disposition of the appeal is appropriate. While subsection (e)(5) provides that a single member may refer an appeal to a three-member panel, this court has not interpreted the subsection to require such a referral. See Gutnik v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 683, 691 (7th Cir.2006). The fact that petitioners' appeal may have been eligible for review by a three-member panel under the standards of the BIA's case management plan but was instead reviewed by a single member acting alone is irrelevant. In our view, it is apparent from the plain language of § 1003.1(e) that discretion in these matters is left to the panel member assigned to the case.The heart of petitioners' argument is that the decision issued by a single BIA member in the case was not a “brief” order, as the language of subsection (e)(5) describes. Because the decision was perhaps lengthier than the average single-member decision, they argue the decision could only have appropriately been rendered by a three-member panel. This dogged focus on what is or is not “brief” provides no substantive evidence of abuse of discretion under the guidelines. To require referral to a three-member panel in each case that lends itself to more than a cookie-cutter order would be contrary to the plain language of § 1003.1(e). It would also “greatly weaken the designed effect [of the regulations] by encouraging BIA members to ignore the subsection (e)(5) procedure altogether and send anything requiring elaboration to a three-member panel.” Id. at 692. We find that the language of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 is sufficiently clear in allowing a single member of the BIA to issue an order such as the one rendered in petitioners' case. Ergo, we cannot find that the BIA violated the review procedures set forth in § 1003.1(e) when a single member rendered a decision on petitioners' appeal in his discretion without referring it to a panel of three. Having found no violation, we need not consider whether petitioners were prejudiced by the way the appeal was handled.III. CONCLUSIONWhile it may be prudent to require that certain appeals to the BIA be adjudicated by a three-member panel instead of a single member acting alone, we leave it to the drafters of the regulations to enact such a change if they find it to be necessary. In so doing, we preserve the spirit of judicial restraint that has long guided appellate review of administrative agency rules. Petitioners' request to have their appeal remanded for further proceedings before a three-member panel of the BIA is Denied.FOOTNOTES1.  See Gutnik v.
