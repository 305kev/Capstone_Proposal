       " </h3><h2><p align=\"CENTER\">A</p>\n",
       " </h2><p>     On January 27, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order No. 13769, Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.  82 Fed. Reg. 8977 (EO-1).  EO-1 addressed policies and procedures relating to the entry of foreign nationals into this country.  Among other directives, the order suspended entry of foreign nationals from seven countries identified as presenting heightened terrorism risks--Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen--for 90 days.  §3(c).  Executive officials were instructed to review the adequacy of current practices relating to visa adjudications during this 90-day period.  §3(a).  EO-1 also modified refugee policy, suspending the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days and reducing the number of refugees eligible to be admitted to the United States during fiscal year 2017.  §§5(a), (d).</p>\n",
       " <p>     EO-1 was immediately challenged in court.  Just a week after the order was issued, a Federal District Court entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its key provisions.  <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, 2017 WL 462040 (WD Wash., Feb. 3, 2017).  Six days later, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Government's emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal.  <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, 847 F. 3d 1151 (2017).  Rather than continue to litigate EO-1, the Government announced that it would revoke the order and issue a new one.</p>\n",
       " <p>     A second order followed on March 6, 2017.  See Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, Exec. Order No. 13780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13209 (EO-2).  EO-2 describes \"conditions in six of the . . . countries\" as to which EO-1 had suspended entry, stating that these conditions \"demonstrate [that] nationals [of those countries] continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States,\" §1(e), and that \"some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security,\" §1(h).</p>\n",
       " <p>     Having identified these concerns, EO-2 sets out a series of directives patterned on those found in EO-1.  Several are relevant here.  First, EO-2 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a global review to determine whether foreign governments provide adequate information about nationals applying for United States visas.  §2(a).  EO-2 directs the Secretary to report his findings to the President within 20 days of the order's \"effective date,\" after which time those nations identified as deficient will be given 50 days to alter their practices.  §§2(b), (d)-(e).</p>\n",
       " <p>     Second, EO-2 directs that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO-1--Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen--be \"suspended for 90 days from the effective date\" of the order.  §2(c).  EO-2 explains that this pause is necessary to ensure that dangerous individuals do not enter the United States while the Executive is working to establish \"adequate standards . . . to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists\"; in addition, suspending entry will \"temporarily reduce investigative burdens on agencies\" during the Secretary's 20-day review.  <em>Ibid.</em>  A separate section provides for case-by-case waivers of the entry bar.  §3(c).</p>\n",
       " <p>     Third, EO-2 suspends \"decisions on applications for refugee status\" and \"travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP\" for 120 days following its effective date.  §6(a).  During that period, the Secretary of State is instructed to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures and implement whatever additional procedures are necessary \"to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat\" to national security.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n",
       " <p>     Fourth, citing the President's determination that \"the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\" EO-2 \"suspend[s] any entries in excess of that number\" for this fiscal year.  §6(b).</p>\n",
       " <p>     Finally, §14 of EO-2 establishes the order's effective date: March 16, 2017.</p>\n",
       " <h3><p align=\"CENTER\">B</p>\n",
       " </h3><p>     Respondents in these cases filed separate lawsuits challenging EO-2.  As relevant, they argued that the order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it was motivated not by concerns pertaining to national security, but by animus toward Islam.  They further argued that EO-2 does not comply with certain provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 187, as amended.</p>\n",
       " <p>     In No. 16-1436, a Federal District Court concluded that respondents were likely to succeed on their Establishment Clause claim with respect to §2(c) of EO-2--the provision temporarily suspending entry from six countries--and entered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring the Government from enforcing §2(c) against any foreign national seeking entry to the United States.  <em>International Refugee Assistance Project </em>v. <em>Trump</em>, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1018235 (D Md., Mar. 16, 2017) (<em>IRAP</em>).  The District Court in No. 16-1540--likewise relying on the Establishment Clause--entered a broader preliminary injunction: The court enjoined nationwide enforcement of all of §§2 and 6.  <em>Hawaii</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1167383 (D Haw., Mar. 29, 2017) (entering preliminary injunction); ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1011673 (D Haw., Mar. 15, 2017) (entering temporary restraining order).  In addition to the §2(c) suspension of entry, this injunction covered the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions, the §6(b) reduction in the refugee cap, and the provisions in §§2 and 6 pertaining only to internal executive review.</p>\n",
       " <p>     These orders, entered before EO-2 went into effect, prevented the Government from initiating enforcement of the challenged provisions.  The Government filed appeals in both cases.</p>\n",
       " <p>     The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled first.  On May 25, over three dissenting votes, the en banc court issued a decision in <em>IRAP</em> that largely upheld the order enjoining enforcement of §2(c).  857 F. 3d 554.  The majority determined that respondent John Doe #1, a lawful permanent resident whose Iranian wife is seeking entry to the United States, was likely to succeed on the merits of his Establishment Clause claim.  The majority concluded that the primary purpose of §2(c) was religious, in violation of the First Amendment: A reasonable observer familiar with all the circumstances--including the predominantly Muslim character of the designated countries and statements made by President Trump during his Presidential campaign--would conclude that §2(c) was motivated principally by a desire to exclude Muslims from the United States, not by considerations relating to national security.  Having reached this conclusion, the court upheld the preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of §2(c) against any foreign national seeking to enter this country.</p>\n",
       " <p>     On June 1, the Government filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of the Fourth Circuit's decision.  It also filed applications seeking stays of both injunctions, including the <em>Hawaii</em> injunction still pending before the Ninth Circuit.  In addition, the Government requested that this Court expedite the certiorari stage briefing.  We accordingly directed respondents to file responses to the stay applications by June 12 and respondents in <em>IRAP</em> to file a brief in opposition to the Government's petition for certiorari by the same day.</p>\n",
       " <p>     Respondents' June 12 filings injected a new issue into the cases.  In <em>IRAP</em>, respondents argued that the suspension of entry in §2(c) would expire on June 14.  Section 2(c), they reasoned, directs that entry \"be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of\" EO-2.  The \"effective date\" of EO-2 was March 16.  §14.  Although courts had enjoined portions of EO-2, they had not altered its effective date, nor so much as mentioned §14.  Thus, even though it had never been enforced, the entry suspension would expire 90 days from March 16: June 14.  At that time, the dispute over §2(c) would become moot.  Brief in Opposition 13-14.</p>\n",
       " <p>     On the same day respondents filed, the Ninth Circuit ruled in <em>Hawaii</em>.  ___ F. 3d ___, 2017 WL 2529640 (June 12, 2017) ( <em>per curiam</em>).  A unanimous panel held in favor of respondents the State of Hawaii and Dr. Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen and imam whose Syrian mother-in-law is seeking entry to this country.  Rather than rely on the constitutional grounds supporting the District Court's decision, the court held that portions of EO-2 likely exceeded the President's authority under the INA.  On that basis it upheld the injunction as to the §2(c) entry suspension, the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions, and the §6(b) refugee cap.  The Ninth Circuit, like the Fourth Circuit, concluded that the injunction should bar enforcement of these provisions across the board, because they would violate the INA \"in all applications.\"  <em>Id</em>., at *28.  The court did, however, narrow the injunction so that it would not bar the Government from undertaking the internal executive reviews directed by EO-2.</p>\n",
       " <p>     We granted the parties' requests for supplemental briefing addressed to the decision of the Ninth Circuit.  Before those briefs were filed, however, the ground shifted again.  On June 14, evidently in response to the argument that §2(c) was about to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials.  The memorandum declared the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO-2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases \"are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.\"  Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence (June 14, 2017).  The memorandum further provided that, to the extent necessary, it \"should be construed to amend the Executive Order.\"  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Government takes the view that, if any mootness problem existed previously, the President's memorandum has cured it.</p>\n",
       " <p>     The parties have since completed briefing, with the Government requesting that we construe its supplemental brief in <em>Hawaii</em> as a petition for certiorari.  There is no objection from respondents, and we do so.  Both petitions for certiorari and both stay applications are accordingly ripe for consideration.</p>\n",
       " <h3><p align=\"CENTER\">II</p>\n",
       " </h3><p>     The Government seeks review on several issues.  In <em>IRAP</em>, the Government argues that respondent Doe lacks standing to challenge §2(c).<sup><a href=\"#FNopinion1.*\" name=\"FRopinion1.*\">*</a></sup>  The Government also contends that Doe's Establishment Clause claim fails on the merits.  In its view, the Fourth Circuit should not have asked whether §2(c) has a primarily religious purpose.  The court instead should have upheld EO-2 because it rests on the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" justification of protecting national security.  <em>Kleindienst</em> v. <em>Mandel</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/408/753.html#770\">408 U. S. 753, 770</a> (1972).  In addition, the Fourth Circuit erred by focusing on the President's campaign-trail comments to conclude that §2(c)--religiously neutral on its face--nonetheless has a principally religious purpose.  At the very least, the Government argues, the injunction is too broad.</p>\n",
       " <p>     In <em>Hawaii</em>, the Government likewise argues that respondents Hawaii and Dr. Elshikh lack standing and that (at a minimum) the injunction should be narrowed.  The Government's principal merits contention pertains to a statutory provision authorizing the President to \"suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\" to this country \"[w]henever [he] finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens . . . would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"  8 U. S. C. §1182(f).  The Ninth Circuit held that \"[t]here is no sufficient finding in [EO-2] that the entry of the excluded classes would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"  <em>Hawaii</em>, 2017 WL 2529640, at *14.  This, the Government argues, constitutes impermissible judicial second-guessing of the President's judgment on a matter of national security.</p>\n",
       " <p>     In addition to seeking certiorari, the Government asks the Court to stay the injunctions entered below, thereby permitting the enjoined provisions to take effect.  According to the Government, it is likely to suffer irreparable harm unless a stay issues.  Focusing mostly on §2(c), and pointing to the descriptions of conditions in the six designated nations, the Government argues that a 90-day pause on entry is necessary to prevent potentially dangerous individuals from entering the United States while the Executive reviews the adequacy of information provided by foreign governments in connection with visa adjudications.  Additionally, the Government asserts, the temporary bar is needed to reduce the Executive's investigative burdens while this review proceeds.</p>\n",
       " <h3><p align=\"CENTER\">A</p>\n",
       " </h3><p>     To begin, we grant both of the Government's petitions for certiorari and consolidate the cases for argument.  The Clerk is directed to set a briefing schedule that will permit the cases to be heard during the first session of October Term 2017.  (The Government has not requested that we expedite consideration of the merits to a greater extent.)  In addition to the issues identified in the petitions, the parties are directed to address the following question: \"Whether the challenges to §2(c) became moot on June 14, 2017.\"</p>\n",
       " <h3><p align=\"CENTER\">B</p>\n",
       " </h3><p>     We now turn to the preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the §2(c) entry suspension.  We grant the Government's applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of §2(c) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  We leave the injunctions entered by the lower courts in place with respect to respondents and those similarly situated, as specified in this opinion.  See <em>infra,</em> at 11-12.</p>\n",
       " <p>     Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.  See <em>Winter</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/555/7.html#20\">555 U. S. 7, 20</a>, 24 (2008); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2948 (3d ed. 2013).  The purpose of such interim equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties, <em>University of Tex. </em>v. <em>Camenisch</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/451/390.html#395\">451 U. S. 390, 395</a> (1981), but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward.  In awarding a preliminary injunction a court must also \"conside[r] . . . the overall public interest.\"  <em>Winter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 26.  In the course of doing so, a court \"need not grant the total relief sought by the applicant but may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.\"  Wright, <em>supra</em>, §2947, at 115.</p>\n",
       " <p>     Here, of course, we are not asked to grant a preliminary injunction, but to stay one.  In assessing the lower courts' exercise of equitable discretion, we bring to bear an equitable judgment of our own.  <em>Nken </em>v. <em>Holder</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/556/418.html#433\">556 U. S. 418, 433</a> (2009).  Before issuing a stay, \"[i]t is ultimately necessary . . . to balance the equities--to explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.\"  <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical &amp; Surgical Ins. Plan</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/501/1301.html#1305\">501 U. S. 1301, 1305</a> (1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court may, in its discretion, tailor a stay so that it operates with respect to only \"some portion of the proceeding.\"  <em>Nken</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 428.</p>\n",
       " <p>     The courts below took account of the equities in fashioning interim relief, focusing specifically on the concrete burdens that would fall on Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii if §2(c) were enforced.  They reasoned that §2(c) would \"directly affec[t]\" Doe and Dr. Elshikh by delaying entry of their family members to the United States.  <em>IRAP</em>, 857 F. 3d, at 585, n. 11; see <em>Hawaii</em>, 2017 WL 2529640, at *7-*8, *24.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that §2(c) would harm the State by preventing students from the designated nations who had been admitted to the University of Hawaii from entering this country.  These hardships, the courts reasoned, were sufficiently weighty and immediate to outweigh the Government's interest in enforcing §2(c).  Having adopted this view of the equities, the courts approved injunctions that covered not just respondents, but parties similarly situated to them--that is, people or entities in the United States who have relationships with foreign nationals abroad, and whose rights might be affected if those foreign nationals were excluded.  See <em>Mandel</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/408/753.html#763\">408 U. S., at 763</a>-765 (permitting American plaintiffs to challenge the exclusion of a foreign national on the ground that the exclusion violated their own First Amendment rights).</p>\n",
       " <p>     But the injunctions reach much further than that: They also bar enforcement of §2(c) against foreign nationals abroad who have no connection to the United States at all.  The equities relied on by the lower courts do not balance the same way in that context.  Denying entry to such a foreign national does not burden any American party by reason of that party's relationship with the foreign national.  And the courts below did not conclude that exclusion  in such circumstances would impose any legally relevant hardship on the foreign national himself.  See <em>id</em>., at 762 (\"[A]n unadmitted and nonresident alien . . . ha[s] no constitutional right of entry to this country\").  So whatever burdens may result from enforcement of §2(c) against a foreign national who lacks any connection to this country, they are, at a minimum, a good deal less concrete than the hardships identified by the courts below.</p>\n",
       " <p>     At the same time, the Government's interest in enforcing §2(c), and the Executive's authority to do so, are undoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign national and the United States.  Indeed, EO-2 itself distinguishes between foreign nationals who have some connection to this country, and foreign nationals who do not, by establishing a case-by-case waiver system primarily for the benefit of individuals in the former category.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, §§3(c)(i)-(vi).  The interest in preserving national security is \"an urgent objective of the highest order.\"  <em>Holder</em> v. <em>Humanitarian Law Project</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/561/1.html#28\">561 U. S. 1, 28</a> (2010).  To prevent the Government from pursuing that objective by enforcing §2(c) against foreign nationals unconnected to the United States would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else.</p>\n",
       " <p>     We accordingly grant the Government's stay applications in part and narrow the scope of the injunctions as to §2(c).  The injunctions remain in place only with respect to parties similarly situated to Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii.  In practical terms, this means that §2(c) may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  All other foreign nationals are subject to the provisions of EO-2.</p>\n",
       " <p>     The facts of these cases illustrate the sort of relationship that qualifies.  For individuals, a close familial relationship is required.  A foreign national who wishes to enter the United States to live with or visit a family member, like Doe's wife or Dr. Elshikh's mother-in-law, clearly has such a relationship.  As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading EO-2.  The students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity.  So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.  Not so someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid §2(c): For example, a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.</p>\n",
       " <p>     In light of the June 12 decision of the Ninth Circuit vacating the injunction as to §2(a), the executive review directed by that subsection may proceed promptly, if it is not already underway.  EO-2 instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to complete this review within 20 days, after which time foreign governments will be given 50 days further to bring their practices into line with the Secretary's directives.  §§2(a)-(b), (d).  Given the Government's representations in this litigation concerning the resources required to complete the 20-day review, we fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments within the 90-day life of §2(c).</p>\n",
       " <h3><p align=\"CENTER\">C</p>\n",
       " </h3><p>     The <em>Hawaii </em>injunction extends beyond §2(c) to bar enforcement of the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions and the §6(b) refugee cap.  In our view, the equitable balance struck above applies in this context as well.  An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded.  As to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction.  But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government's compelling need to provide for the Nation's security.  See <em>supra,</em> at 9-11; <em>Haig </em>v. <em>Agee</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/453/280.html#307\">453 U. S. 280, 307</a> (1981).</p>\n",
       " <p>     The Government's application to stay the injunction with respect to §§6(a) and (b) is accordingly granted in part.  Section 6(a) may not be enforced against an individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  Nor may §6(b); that is, such a person may not be excluded pursuant to §6(b), even if the 50,000-person cap has been reached or exceeded.  As applied to all other individuals, the provisions may take effect.</p>\n",

       " <p>     I agree with the Court that the preliminary injunctions entered in these cases should be stayed, although I would stay them in full.  The decision whether to stay the injunctions is committed to our discretion, <em>ante</em>, at 9-10, but our discretion must be \"guided by sound legal principles,\" <em>Nken</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/556/418.html#434\">556 U. S. 418, 434</a> (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The two \"most critical\" factors we must consider in deciding whether to grant a stay are \"(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits\" and \"(2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay.\"  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Where a party seeks a stay pending certiorari, as here, the applicant satisfies the first factor only if it can show both \"a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted\" and \"a significant possibility that the judgment below will be reversed.\"  <em>Barnes</em> v. <em>E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical &amp; Surgical Ins. Plan</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/501/1301.html#1302\">501 U. S. 1301, 1302</a> (1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers).  When we determine that those critical factors are satisfied, we must \"balance the equities\" by \"explor[ing] the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.\"  <em>Id.</em>, at 1304-1305 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. <em>Nken</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 435 (noting that the factors of \"assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest\" \"merge when the Government is the opposing party\").</p>\n",
       " <p>     The Government has satisfied the standard for issuing a stay pending certiorari.  We have, of course, decided to grant certiorari.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8-9.  And I agree with the Court's implicit conclusion that the Government has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits--that is, that the judgments below will be reversed.  The Government has also established that failure to stay the injunctions will cause irreparable harm by interfering with its \"compelling need to provide for the Nation's security.\"  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  Finally, weighing the Government's interest in preserving national security against the hardships caused to respondents by temporary denials of entry into the country, the balance of the equities favors the Government.  I would thus grant the Government's applications for a stay in their entirety.</p>\n",
       " <p>     Reasonable minds may disagree on where the balance of equities lies as between the Government and respondents in these cases.  It would have been reasonable, perhaps, for the Court to have left the injunctions in place only as to respondents themselves.  But the Court takes the additional step of keeping the injunctions in place with regard to an unidentified, unnamed group of foreign nationals abroad.  No class has been certified, and neither party asks for the scope of relief that the Court today provides.  \"[I]njunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief <em>to the plaintiffs</em>\" in the case, <em>Califano</em> v. <em>Yamasaki</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/442/682.html#702\">442 U. S. 682, 702</a> (1979) (emphasis added), because a court's role is \"to provide relief\" only \"to claimants . . . who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm.\"  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/518/343.html#349\">518 U. S. 343, 349</a> (1996).  In contrast, it is the role of the \"political branches\" to \"shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.\"  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n",
       " <p>     Moreover, I fear that the Court's remedy will prove unworkable.  Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding--on peril of contempt--whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11-12.  The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a \"bona fide relationship,\" who precisely has a \"credible claim\" to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed \"simply to avoid §2(c)\" of Executive Order No. 13780, <em>ante</em>, at 11, 12.  And litigation of the factual and legal issues that are likely to arise will presumably be directed to the two District Courts whose initial orders in these cases this Court has now--unanimously--found sufficiently questionable to be stayed as to the vast majority of the people potentially affected.</p>\n",

       " <p>Petitioner, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, faced deportation after committing two misdemeanor drug offenses in Texas.  For the first, possession of a small amount of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.  For the second, possession without a prescription of one antianxiety tablet, he received 10 days.  Texas law, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhancement if the State proved that petitioner had been previously convicted of a similar offense, but Texas did not seek such an enhancement here.  After the second conviction, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings.  Petitioner conceded that he was removable, but claimed that he was eligible for discretionary cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) because he had not been convicted of any \"aggravated felony,\" 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3).  Section 1101(a)(43)(B) defines that term to include, <em>inter alia, </em>\"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance ... including a drug trafficking crime\" as defined in 18 U. S. C. §924(c), which, in turn, defines a \"drug trafficking crime\" as a \"felony punishable under,\" <em>inter alia</em>, \"the Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq<em>.</em>).\"  A felony is a crime for which the \"maximum term of imprisonment authorized\" is \"more than one year.\"  §3559(a).  Simple possession offenses are ordinarily misdemeanors punishable with shorter sentences, but a conviction \"after a prior conviction under this subchapter [or] the law of any State ... has become final\"--a \"recidivist\" simple possession offense--is \"punishable\" as a \"felony\" under §924(c)(2) and subject to a 2-year sentence.  Only this \"recidivist\" simple possession category might be an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43).  A prosecutor must charge the existence of the prior conviction.  See 21 U. S. C. §851(a)(1).  Notice and an opportunity to challenge its validity, §§851(b)-(c), are mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of the prior conviction and necessary prerequisites to \"authorize\" a felony punishment, 18 U. S. C. §3559(a), for the simple possession offense at issue.</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "           Here, the Immigration Judge held that petitioner's second simple possession conviction was an \"aggravated felony\" that made him ineligible for cancellation of removal.  The Board of Immigration Appeals and Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on the holding in <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/47.html#56\">549 U. S. 47, 56</a>--that to be an \"aggravated felony\" for immigration law purposes, a state drug conviction must be punishable as a felony under federal law--the court used a \"hypothetical approach,\" concluding that because petitioner's \"conduct\" could have been prosecuted as a recidivist simple possession under state law, it could have also been punished as a felony under federal law.</p>\n",
       " <p><em>Held: </em>Second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated felonies under §1101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.  Pp. 9-19.</p>\n",
       " <p>     (a) Considering the disputed provisions' terms and their \"commonsense conception,\" <em>Lopez</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/47.html#53\">549 U. S., at 53</a>, it would be counterintuitive and \"unorthodox\" to apply an \"aggravated felony\" or \"illicit trafficking\" label to petitioner's recidivist possession, see <em>id., </em>at 54.  The same is true for his penalty.  One does not usually think of a 10-day sentence for unauthorized possession of one prescription pill as an \"aggravated felony.\"  This Court must be very wary in this case because the Government seeks a result that \"the English language tells [the Court] not to expect.\"  <em>Ibid</em>.  Pp. 9-11.</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      (b) The Government's position--that \"conduct punishable as a felony\" should be treated as the equivalent of a felony conviction when the underlying conduct could have been a felony under federal law--is unpersuasive.  First, it ignores the INA's text, which limits the Attorney General's cancellation power only when, <em>inter alia</em>, a noncitizen \"has ... been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.\"  8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3).  Thus, the conviction itself is the starting place, not what might have or could have been charged.  Under the Controlled Substances Act, simple possession offenses carry only a 1-year sentence unless a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend against that charge.  Here, petitioner's record of conviction contains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.  An immigration court cannot, <em>ex post</em>, enhance the state offense of record just because facts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty.  The Government contends that had petitioner been prosecuted in federal court under identical circumstances, he would have committed an \"aggravated felony\" for immigration law purposes.  But his circumstances were not identical to the Government's hypothesis.  And the Government's approach cannot be reconciled with 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3), which requires an \"aggravated felony\" conviction--not that the noncitizen merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.  Second, the Government's position fails to effectuate 21 U. S. C. §851's mandatory notice and process requirements, which have great practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are integral to the structure and design of federal drug laws.  They authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement.  So do many state criminal codes, including Texas'.  Permitting an immigration judge to apply his own recidivist enhancement after the fact would denigrate state prosecutors' independent judgment to execute such laws.  Third, the Fifth Circuit misread <em>Lopez.</em>  This Court never used a \"hypothetical approach\" in its analysis.  By focusing on facts known to the immigration court that could have <em>but did not</em> serve as the basis for the state conviction and punishment, the Circuit's approach introduces a level of conjecture that has no basis in <em>Lopez.  </em>Fourth, the Government's argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts, for it is quite unlikely that petitioner's conduct would have been punished as a felony in federal court.  Finally, as the Court noted in <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/543/1.html#11\">543 U. S. 1, 11</a>, n. 8, ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the noncitizen's favor.  Notably, here, the question whether petitioner has committed an \"aggravated felony\" is relevant to the type of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact removable.  Thus, any relief he may obtain still depends on the Attorney General's discretion.  Pp. 11-18.</p>\n",

       "      Petitioner Jose Angel Carachuri-Rosendo, a lawful permanent resident who has lived in the United States since he was five years old, faced deportation under federal law after he committed two misdemeanor drug possession offenses in Texas.  For the first, possession of less than two ounces of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.  For the second, possession without a prescription of one tablet of a common antianxiety medication, he received 10 days in jail.  After this second offense, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings against him.  He conceded that he was removable, but claimed he was eligible for discretionary relief from removal under 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a).</p>\n",

       " \n",
       "      To decide whether Carachuri-Rosendo is eligible to seek cancellation of removal or waiver of inadmissibility under §1229b(a), we must decide whether he has been convicted of an \"aggravated felony,\" §1229b(a)(3), a category of crimes singled out for the harshest deportation consequences.  The Court of Appeals held that a simple drug possession offense, committed after the conviction for a first possession offense became final, is always an aggravated felony.  We now reverse and hold that second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated felonies under §1101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.</p>\n",
       " <h3><p align=\"CENTER\">I</p>\n",
       " </h3><p>\n",
       "      Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1101 <em>et seq., </em>a lawful permanent resident subject to removal from the United States may apply for discretionary cancellation of removal if, <em>inter alia</em>, he \"has not been convicted of any aggravated felony,\" §1229b(a)(3).  The statutory definition of the term \"aggravated felony\" includes a list of numerous federal offenses,<sup><a href=\"#FNopinion1.1\" name=\"FRopinion1.1\">1</a></sup> one of which is \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\"  §1101(a)(43)(B).  Section 924(c)(2), in turn, defines a \"drug trafficking crime\" to mean \"any felony punishable under,\" <em>inter alia</em>, \"the Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq<em>.</em>).\"  A felony is a crime for which the \"maximum term of imprisonment authorized\" is \"more than one year.\"  18 U. S. C. §3559(a).<sup><a href=\"#FNopinion1.2\" name=\"FRopinion1.2\">2</a></sup></p>\n",
       " <p>     The maze of statutory cross-references continues.  Section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act criminalizes simple possession offenses, the type of offense at issue in this case.  But it prescribes punishment for both misdemeanor and felony offenses.  Except for simple possession of crack cocaine or flunitrazepam, a first-time simple possession offense is a federal misdemeanor; the maximum term authorized for such a conviction is less than one year.  21 U. S. C. §844(a).  However, a conviction for a simple possession offense \"after a prior conviction under this subchapter [or] under the law of any State . . . has become final\"--what we will call recidivist simple possession<sup><a href=\"#FNopinion1.3\" name=\"FRopinion1.3\">3</a></sup>--may be punished as a felony, with a prison sentence of up to two years.  <em>Ibid.<sup><a href=\"#FNopinion1.4\" name=\"FRopinion1.4\">4</a></sup></em>  Thus, except for simple possession offenses involving isolated categories of drugs not presently at issue, only <em>recidivist</em> simple possession offenses are \"punishable\" as a federal \"felony\" under the Controlled Substances Act, 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2).

Accordingly, any \"conduct\" that \"hypothetically\" \"could have been punished as a felony\" \"had [it] been prosecuted in federal court\" is an \"aggravated felony\" for federal immigration law purposes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 265.  In applying this hypothetical approach, the Court of Appeals did not discuss the §851 procedural requirements.

An \"aggravated\" offense is one \"made worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another crime.\"  <em>Id.,</em> at 75.  The term \"aggravated felony\" is unique to Title 8, which covers immigration matters; it is not a term used elsewhere within the United States Code.

We find this reasoning--and the \"hypothetical approach\" itself--unpersuasive for the following reasons.</p>\n",
       " <p>     First, and most fundamentally, the Government's position ignores the text of the INA, which limits the Attorney General's cancellation power only when, <em>inter alia</em>, a noncitizen \"has . . . been <em>convicted</em> of a[n] aggravated felony.\"  8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3) (emphasis added).  The text thus indicates that we are to look to the conviction itself as our starting place, not to what might have or could have been charged.  And to be convicted of an aggravated felony punishable as such under the Controlled Substances Act, the \"maximum term of imprisonment authorized\" must be \"more than one year,\" 18 U. S. C. §3559(a)(5).  Congress, recall, chose to authorize only a 1-year sentence for nearly all simple possession offenses, but it created a narrow exception for those cases in which a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend against that charge.

       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      Indisputably, Carachuri-Rosendo's record of conviction contains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.  Carachuri-Rosendo argues that even such a finding would be insufficient, and that a prosecutorial charge of recidivism and an opportunity to defend against that charge also would be required before he could be deemed \"convicted\" of a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.  In the absence of any finding of recidivism, we need not, and do not, decide whether these additional procedures would be necessary.  Although a federal immigration court may have the power to make a recidivist finding in the first instance, see<em>,</em> <em>e.g</em>., <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/224.html#247\">523 U. S. 224, 247</a> (1998), it cannot, <em>ex post</em>, enhance the state offense of record just because facts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty under either state or federal law.<sup><a href=\"#FNopinion1.11\" name=\"FRopinion1.11\">11</a></sup>  Carachuri-Rosendo was not actually \"convicted,\" §1229b(a)(3), of a drug possession offense committed \"after a prior conviction . . . has become final,\" §844(a), and no subsequent development can undo that history.<sup><a href=\"#FNopinion1.12\" name=\"FRopinion1.12\">12</a></sup></p>\n",

       "      The Government contends that if Carachuri-Rosendo had been prosecuted in federal court for simple possession under 21 U. S. C. §844(a) under identical circumstances, he would have committed an \"aggravated felony\" for immigration law purposes.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37.  This is so, the Government suggests, because the only statutory text that matters is the word \"punishable\" in 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2): Whatever conduct might be \"punishable\" as a felony, regardless of whether it actually is so punished or not, is a felony for immigration law purposes.  But for the reasons just stated, the circumstances of Carachuri-Rosendo's prosecution were not identical to those hypothesized by the Government.  And the Government's abstracted approach to §924(c)(2) cannot be reconciled with the more concrete guidance of 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3), which limits the Attorney General's cancellation authority only when the noncitizen has actually been \"convicted of a[n] aggravated felony\"--not when he merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      Second, and relatedly, the Government's position fails to give effect to the mandatory notice and process requirements contained in 21 U. S. C. §851.  For federal law purposes, a simple possession offense is not \"punishable\" as a felony unless a federal prosecutor first elects to charge a defendant as a recidivist in the criminal information.  The statute, as described in Part I, <em>supra</em>, at 3-4, speaks in mandatory terms, permitting \"[n]o person\" to be subject to a recidivist enhancement--and therefore, in this case, a felony sentence--\"unless\" he has been given notice of the Government's intent to prove the fact of a prior conviction.  Federal law also gives the defendant an opportunity to challenge the fact of the prior conviction itself.  §§851(b)-(c).  The Government would dismiss these procedures as meaningless, so long as they may be satisfied during the immigration proceeding.</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      But these procedural requirements have great practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are integral to the structure and design of our drug laws.  They authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dodson</em>, 288 F. 3d 153, 159 (CA5 2002) (\"Whereas the prior version of [§851(a)] made enhancements for prior offenses mandatory, the new statutory scheme gave prosecutors discretion whether to seek enhancements based on prior convictions\").  Because the procedures are prerequisites to an enhanced sentence, §851 allows federal prosecutors to choose whether to seek a conviction that is \"punishable\" as a felony under §844(a).  Underscoring the significance of the §851 procedures, the United States Attorney's Manual places decisions with respect to seeking recidivist enhancements on par with the filing of a criminal charge against a defendant.  See Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual §9-27.300(B) comment. (1997), online at http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/ usam/title9/27mcrm.htm#9-27.300 (as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).

       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      Many state criminal codes, like the federal scheme, afford similar deference to prosecutorial discretion when prescribing recidivist enhancements.  Texas is one such State.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Tex. Penal Code Ann. §§12.42, 12.43 (West 2003) (recidivist enhancement is available \"[i]f it is shown on the trial\" that defendant was previously convicted of identified categories of felonies and misdemeanors).  And, in this case, the prosecutor specifically elected to \"[a]bandon\" a recidivist enhancement under state law.  App. 32a (reproducing state judgment).  Were we to permit a federal immigration judge to apply his own recidivist enhancement after the fact so as to make the noncitizen's offense \"punishable\" as a felony for immigration law purposes, we would denigrate the independent judgment of state prosecutors to execute the laws of those sovereigns.</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      Third, the Court of Appeals' hypothetical felony approach is based on a misreading of our decision in <em>Lopez</em>.  We never used the term \"hypothetical\" to describe our analysis in that case.  We did look to the \"proscribe[d] conduct\" of a state offense to determine whether it is \"punishable as a felony under that federal law.\"  <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/47.html#60\">549 U. S., at 60</a>.  But the \"hypothetical approach\" employed by the Court of Appeals introduces a level of conjecture at the outset of this inquiry that has no basis in <em>Lopez</em>.  It ignores both the conviction (the relevant statutory hook), and the conduct actually punished by the state offense.  Instead, it focuses on facts known to the immigration court that could have <em>but did not</em> serve as the basis for the state conviction and punishment.  As the Sixth Circuit has explained, this approach is really a \" 'hypothetical to a hypothetical.' \"  <em>Rashid </em>v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 531 F. 3d 438, 445 (2008).  Not only does the Government wish us to consider a fictional federal felony--whether the crime for which Carachuri-Rosendo was actually convicted would be a felony under the Controlled Substances Act--but the Government also wants us to consider facts not at issue in the crime of conviction (<em>i.e.</em>, the existence of a prior conviction) to determine whether Carachuri-Rosendo <em>could have </em>been charged with a federal felony.  This methodology is far removed from the more focused, categorical inquiry employed in <em>Lopez</em>.</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      Fourth, it seems clear that the Government's argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts.  It is quite unlikely that the \"conduct\" that gave rise to Carachuri-Rosendo's conviction would have been punished as a felony in federal court.  Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, Carachuri-Rosendo's recommended sentence, based on the type of controlled substance at issue, would not have exceeded one year and very likely would have been less than 6 months.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2D2.1(a)(3) (Nov. 2009) (base offense level of 4).  And as was true in <em>Lopez, </em>the Government has provided us with no empirical data suggesting that \"even a single eager Assistant United States Attorney\" has ever sought to prosecute a comparable federal defendant as a felon.  <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/47.html#57\">549 U. S., at 57</a>-58.  The Government's \"hypothetical\" approach to this case is therefore misleading as well as speculative, in that Carachuri-Rosendo's federal-court counterpart would <em>not</em>, in actuality, have faced any felony charge.</p>\n",
       " <p>     Finally, as we noted in <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/543/1.html#11\">543 U. S. 1, 11</a>, n. 8 (2004), ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the noncitizen's favor.  And here the critical language appears in a criminal statute, 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2).  </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an \"aggravated felony\" is relevant, <em>inter alia</em>, to the type of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact removable.  In other words, to the extent that our rejection of the Government's broad understanding of the scope of \"aggravated felony\" may have any practical effect on policing our Nation's borders, it is a limited one.  Carachuri-Rosendo, and others in his position, may now seek cancellation of removal and thereby avoid the harsh consequence of mandatory removal.  But he will not avoid the fact that his conviction makes him, in the first instance, removable.  Any relief he may obtain depends upon the discretion of the Attorney General.</p>\n",
       " <h3><p align=\"CENTER\">*  *  *</p>\n",
       " </h3><p>\n",
       "      In sum, the Government is correct that to qualify as an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA, the conduct prohibited by state law must be punishable as a felony under federal law.  See <em>Lopez</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/47.html#60\">549 U. S., at 60</a>.  But as the text and structure of the relevant statutory provisions demonstrate, the defendant must <em>also</em> have been<em> actually convicted</em> of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under federal law.  The mere possibility that the defendant's conduct, coupled with facts outside of the record of conviction, could have authorized a felony conviction under federal law is insufficient to satisfy the statutory command that a noncitizen be \"convicted of a[n] aggravated felony\" before he loses the opportunity to seek cancellation of removal.  8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3).  The Court of Appeals, as well as the Government, made the logical error of assuming that a necessary component of an aggravated felony is also sufficient to satisfy its statutory definition.</p>\n",

There is no statutory definition of \"convicted,\" but a \"conviction\" is defined to mean a \"formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.\"  §1101(a)(48)(A).  The term \"aggravated felony\" includes, among many other offenses, \"a drug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S. C. §924(c)]).\"  §1101(a)(43)(B).  A \"drug trafficking crime\" is in turn defined as \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\"  18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2).</p>\n",

       "      It could be concluded from the provisions discussed above that only a <em>federal</em> conviction for a felony offense under the Controlled Substances Act would qualify under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(B).  But the penultimate sentence in §1101(a)(43) provides that the statutory definition of \"aggravated felony\" \"applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\"  This language, we have said, confirms that \"a state offense whose elements include the elements of a felony punishable under the [Controlled Substances Act] is an aggravated felony.\"  <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/47.html#57\">549 U. S. 47, 57</a> (2006).</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      The conceptual problem in the present case is that the only crime defined by 21 U. S. C. §844(a) of the Controlled Substances Act, simple possession of prohibited drugs, is a misdemeanor.  That misdemeanor becomes a \"felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\" only because the sentencing factor of recidivism authorizes additional punishment beyond one year, the criterion for a felony.  We held in <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/224.html\">523 U. S. 224</a> (1998), that recidivism can constitutionally be made a sentencing factor rather than an element of the crime, despite the fact that it is used to increase the allowable sentence.  And we said in <em>Lopez</em> that a \"state possession crim[e] that correspond[s] to\" the \"felony violatio[n]\" of \"recidivist possession\" in §844(a) \"clearly fall[s] within the definitions used by Congress ... in §1101(a)(43)(B) and ... §924(c)(2).\"  <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/47.html#55\">549 U. S., at 55</a>, n. 6.</p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " \n",
       "      But to say all that is not to say that an alien has been \"convicted of\" an aggravated felony (which is what §1229b(a)(3) requires) when he has been convicted of nothing more than a second state misdemeanor violation, the punishment for which could, because of recidivism, be extended beyond one year.  Just because, by reason of <em>Almendarez-Torres</em>,<em> </em>the federal misdemeanor offense has been raised to a felony offense without changing its elements, solely by increasing its penalty pursuant to a recidivist \"sentencing factor\"; it does not follow that when the question is asked whether someone has been \"convicted of\" a state offense that \"corresponds\" to the federal misdemeanor-become-felony, the answer can be sought in sentencing factors.  A defendant is not \"convicted\" of sentencing factors, but only of the elements of the crime charged in the indictment.  In other words, a misdemeanor offense with a sentencing factor that raises its punishment to the felony level qualifies for purposes of establishing the elements of a \"felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\"; but does <em>not </em>qualify for purposes of determining what elements the alien has been \"convicted of.\"     Here, Carachuri-Rosendo was only \"convicted of\" the crime of knowing possession of a controlled substance without a valid prescription, a Class A misdemeanor under Texas law.  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§481.117(a) and (b) (West Supp. 2009).  Since the elements of that crime did not include recidivism, the crime of his conviction did not \"correspond\" to the Controlled Substances Act felony of possession-plus-recidivism under 21 U. S. C. §844(a).</p>\n",

Carachuri-Rosendo's offense of simple possession was \"punishable under the [CSA],\" §924(c)(2), and thus satisfied the second requirement, but his crime of conviction in state court was only a misdemeanor.  Accordingly, that offense does not bar him from obtaining cancellation of removal.</p>\n",

       "      The Fifth Circuit understandably felt constrained by this Court's decision in <em>Lopez </em>to rule otherwise.  In <em>Lopez, </em>this Court held that \"a state offense constitutes a 'felony punishable under the [CSA]' only if it proscribes conduct punishable <em>as a felony </em>under that federal law.\"  <em>Id.</em>, at 60 (emphasis added).  Though <em>Lopez </em>addressed a felony conviction under state law that did not correlate to a felony under the CSA, the Court's rule preordained the result in this case:</p>\n",
       " <blockquote><p>\"[T]he Court admits that its reading will subject an alien defendant convicted of a state misdemeanor to deportation if his conduct was punishable as a felony under the CSA.

True, the statutory scheme comports with <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/224.html#247\">523 U. S. 224, 247</a> (1998), in which we explained that the Constitution does not require treating recidivism as an element of the offense.  In other words, Congress has permissibly set out a criminal offense for simple possession whereby a recidivist finding by the judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, authorizes a punishment that exceeds the statutory maximum penalty for a simple possession offense.  But the fact of a prior conviction must still be found--if only by a judge and if only by a preponderance of the evidence--before a defendant is subject to felony punishment.  For present purposes, we therefore view §844(a)'s felony simple possession provision as separate and distinct from the misdemeanor simple possession offense that section also prescribes.</p>\n",

Our decision today is not in conflict with this footnote; it is still true that recidivist simple possession offenses charged and prosecuted as such \"clearly fall\" within the definition of an aggravated felony.  What we had no occasion to decide in <em>Lopez</em>, and what we now address, is what it means to be <em>convicted </em>of an aggravated felony.  <em>Lopez</em> teaches us that it is necessary that the conduct punished under state law correspond to a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act to be an aggravated felony under §1101(a)(43)(B).  But it does not instruct as to whether the mere possibility that conduct could be--but is not--charged as an offense punishable as a felony under federal law is sufficient.</p>\n",

In that case, we rejected the so-called categorical approach employed in cases like <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rodriquez</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/553/377.html\">553 U. S. 377</a> (2008), when assessing whether, under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i), a noncitizen has committed \"an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the . . . victims exceeds $10,000.\"  Our analysis was tailored to the \"circumstance-specific\" language contained in that particular subsection of the aggravated felony definition.  <em>Nijhawan</em>, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  And we specifically distinguished the \"generic\" categories of aggravated felonies for which a categorical approach might be appropriate--including the \"illicit trafficking\" provision--from the \"circumstance-specific\" offense at hand.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6-7, 8).  Moreover, unlike the instant case, there was no debate in <em>Nijhawan</em> over whether the petitioner actually had been \"convicted\" of fraud; we only considered how to calculate the amount of loss once a conviction for a particular category of aggravated felony has occurred.</p>\n",
       " <br/><strong>Footnote <a href=\"#FRopinion1.12\" name=\"FNopinion1.12\">12</a></strong><br/><p> Linking our inquiry to the record of conviction comports with how we have categorized convictions for state offenses within the definition of generic federal criminal sanctions under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e).  The United States urges that our decision in <em>Rodriquez</em>, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/553/377.html\">553 U. S. 377</a>, an ACCA case, supports its position in this case.  Brief for Respondent 29-30.  To the extent that <em>Rodriquez</em> is relevant to the issue at hand, we think the contrary is true.  In that decision we considered whether a recidivist finding under state law that had the effect of increasing the \"maximum term of imprisonment\" to 10 years, irrespective of the actual sentence imposed, made the offense a \"serious drug offense\" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(1) and therefore an ACCA predicate offense.  <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/553/377.html#382\">553 U. S., at 382</a>.  We held that a recidivist finding could set the \"maximum term of imprisonment,\" but only when the finding is a part of the record of conviction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 389.  Indeed, we specifically observed that \"in those cases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show that the defendant faced the possibility<em> </em>of a recidivist enhancement, it may well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing that a conviction was for a qualifying offense.\"  <em>Ibid.</em>  In other words, when the recidivist finding giving rise to a 10-year sentence is not apparent from the sentence itself, or appears neither as part of the \"judgment of conviction\" nor the \"formal charging document,\" <em>ibid.</em>, the Government will not have established that the defendant had a prior conviction for which the maximum term of imprisonment was 10 years or more (assuming the recidivist finding is a necessary precursor to such a sentence).</p>\n",
