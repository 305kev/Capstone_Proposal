### Motivation

Any U.S. citizen is entitled to legal representation under the law. The same is not true for non-citizens. In immigration court, over 80% of all defendants go unrepresented simply because they cannot afford a lawyer. Legal research stands among the highest costs for defendants. This is where A.I. steps in. Although recent advances in machine learning have affected most major industries, the legal market is notably absent, with a few exceptions. ROSS A.I. is a startup company that has built a search engine built to optimize legal research; however they are solely focused on bankruptcy law. With this project, I intend to build upon their work and expand this ML powered search engine to new areas like immigration law. Below is an example of how it works:
